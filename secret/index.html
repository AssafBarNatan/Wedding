    It seems like the time has come to update this page. A lot of the goals of this party were actually met 
    on Sept. 11-12th, just a bit later in the evening. As such, we are <b>probably cancelling</b> this party, 
    unless there is some serious crowd opposition, in which case, we will hold it on the 18th

    Here's the current plan:
    </p>
    <h2>
      After-AFTER party: Sept. 18, 2021
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Honestly, we haven't really thought this far ahead but whatever. A party's a party, and 
      we're just gonna roll with it.
    </h3>
    <h4>
      Some drugs may be provided, but if you want something specific, you'll have to get 
      it yourself.
