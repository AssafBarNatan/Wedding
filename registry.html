      The truth of the matter is that Sarah and I have been living
      together for a while now, and are not in great need of any 
      household items. Well, that's not exactly true: we need 
      some new chairs, a lemon zester, a cake lifter, plastic tongs, 
      and a new bag of whole wheat flour.

      All jokes aside, keep an eye on this page (and sign up 
      for the e-mail updates at the <a href="./rsvp.html"> RSVP 
        page!</a>) for charities we support and 
      how we'd like to give back to our community 
      for our wedding.
