      Event Details
    </h3>
    <p>
    A full week of sitting by the beach, soaking sun, relaxing, and 
    campfires. Think of it as our public honeymoon, where you're 
    invited to come, hang out, visit, and catch up on life.
    </p>
    <p>
    We will be going around Tel-Aviv, but we will always carry a trusty GPS 
    with us, and posting our schedule LIVE right here, so if you want to 
    join us for a movie, a play, or just a long walk by the sea, you 
    can come by!
